== Welcome

MrTips is a 2-Class library that easily enables you to display help in your Android app.

It's been design and coded by [[Thomas Ezan|tezan.enssat@gmail.com]]

== Getting started

1. Download mrtipsX.Y.jar (in /build folder) and add it to your build path
OR add mrtips.* package into your project.

2. Add mrtips_array.xml to /value (in /example/res/value) 

3. instanciate a TipsDisplayer passing a string array initialized with the tips id list (cf. MrTipsExample activity in /example/src).
   
4. call showTipsDialog on the TipsDisplayer.


== Tips declaration

Tips are added to /value/mrtips_array.xml following this pattern :

<ressource>
  ..
  <array name="id">
        <item>title label resource id in string.xml file(optional, but empty if n/a)</item>
        <item>image name (without extension)</item>
        <item>description label resource id string.xml file</item>
        <item>checkbox label resource id string.xml file</item>
  </array>
  ..
<ressources>

You can add as many tips as you want. You must keep these four items order for each array. 

Title label :
Title label optional but the first "item" tag is required. So put an empty "item" tag if you don't want any title label.

Images :
To display an image on the popup, you just need to add the .png-file to /drawable and write the name of the image (without extension).
